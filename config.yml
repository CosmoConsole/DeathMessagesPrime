item-names:
  # Use this section to provide custom translations for items when used in a
  # death message to replace %weapon% or %weapon_name%.
  # See list of options here:

  #   (these may change depending on the Minecraft version)
  # Example:
  # IRON_SWORD: "Iron Sword"

custom-mob-death-messages:
  # The following attribute takes in regular expressions and checks top-down 
  # whether the names of the mobs match them.
  # If there is no list, as in [], the plugin will look up the message from 
  # the normal death messages.
  # If the list only has an empty message, the death message for that mob will 
  # be hidden.
  # To match color codes, use the § character instead of &. (This file must be 
  # encoded in UTF-8)
  # Examples:
  #
  # "_*": # match all mobs
  #   - "%plrtag% was killed by a mob"
  #
  # "^[Ss]_*": # match all mobs beginning with S or s
  #   - "%plrtag% was killed by a mob"
  #
  # "§cMy Custom Boss": [] # display normal messages for mobs named 
  #                        # 'My Custom Boss' written in red
  #
  # "My Custom Boss": # match all mobs with name being 'My Custom Boss'
  #   - "%plrtag% was killed by a boss"
  #   - "%plrtag% was pummeled by a boss"
  #
  # "§aMy Custom Boss": # match all mobs with name being 'My Custom Boss' 
  #                     # written in light green
  #   - "%plrtag% was killed by a boss"
  #   - "%plrtag% was pummeled by a boss"
  #
  # "_*My Custom Boss_*": # match all mobs with name containing 'My Custom Boss'
  #   - "%plrtag% was killed by a boss"
  #   - "%plrtag% was pummeled by a boss"
